# Leaflet Widget

This port is work in progress, do not use this on productions sites yet!

A [Geofield] widget that provides a [Leaflet] map widget with the
[Leaflet.widget] plugin for adding features. [Leaflet.widget] uses the
[Leaflet.draw] geometry creation tools.

## Features:

- Create & manage simple geometries: Point, LineString, Polygon.
- Maintains complex geometries: MultiPoint, MultiLineString, MultiPolygon and
  GeometryCollection. (These can't be created yet but it won't mess with your
  existing data.)
- Delete geometries.
- Supports single or multi-value Geofields (cardinality).
- Use base layers defined by [Leaflet module].
