# Geofield Leaflet

A [Geofield] widget that provides a [Leaflet] map with the [Leaflet.draw] 
plugin for adding features.

## Installation tips:

- Currently Geofield Leaflet uses the [Leaflet] library provided by the 
[Leaflet Drupal] module.  
- This module requires the latest dev release of [GeoPHP] as there are issues 
with parsing GeoJSON in the latest stable release.
- Make sure you have the most recent version of the [Leaflet.draw] plugin in 
your 'libraries' directory (see [Libraries API].
